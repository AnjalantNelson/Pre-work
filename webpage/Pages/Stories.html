	<h1> Hello, I'm Anjalant, but you can call me Aj.</h1>
	<h2> In my free time I enjoy playing video games, reading, studying philosophy, sociology, as well as writing poetry. I also enjoy learning about technology and how it works. My favorite memory of working with technology is when I was in high school and I wanted to bypass the administrator privilges. I looked up a video on youtube and it showed me how, and I still remember how to do it to this day.</h2>
